The Voice Converter is a web application that converts spoken words into text or vice versa using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can input voice recordings or text, and the application converts them accordingly. With a simple and intuitive interface, users can easily interact with the conversion tool. Leveraging JavaScript's SpeechRecognition API for voice-to-text conversion and Text-to-Speech (TTS) libraries for text-to-voice conversion, the app provides real-time feedback and conversion results. This tool serves as a handy utility for users who prefer voice-based or text-based communication, enhancing accessibility and convenience.
